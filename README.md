# Machine-Actionable DMP

Template based on the [RDA DMP Common Standard (DCS)](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) for machine-actionable Data Management Plans and the provided [JSON schema](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard/tree/master/examples/JSON/JSON-schema) for machine-actionable DMPs. It also uses the [DCS Ontology](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard/tree/master/ontologies) to allow export in RDF.
